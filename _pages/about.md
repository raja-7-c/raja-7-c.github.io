![Illustration of psycholinguistic and Cognitively Inspired NLP](/images/bcs.png){: .align-right width="300px"}
👨🏻‍💻 I'm a final-year graduate student at IIT Bombay.

🔬 My research interests are in bridging cognitive science and language modalities with a strong focus on leveraging these technologies for positive societal impact!

📚 I'm currently working towards my Master's Thesis at the junction of natural language processing (NLP), machine learning (ML), and computational social science.


# Selected Experience

## 📜 Reimplementing and Reproducing Papers
I've re-implemented and reproduced results from various research papers by conducting and meticulously documenting experiments across a range of courses.

Feel free to look at my specific [portfolio entry](https://sudo-boris.github.io/portfolio/RCPPO/).

## 👨🏻‍🔬 Professional Experience
Additionally, I have professional experience working as an **AI Student Researcher** at Assert AI. \
There, I deployed customized YOLOv4 models for surveillance tasks leveraging the Nvidia Jetson series GPU accelerators, generated tailored datasets, and trained YOLOv4 models for diverse object detection and classification scenarios.

## 📚 Teaching Contributions
As the Head Teaching Assistant for "Introduction to Public Health Informatics" at IIT Bombay, I manage course logistics, assist in evaluating answer scripts, design projects, and conduct tutorials for a large student cohort of 210+.
