👨🏻‍💻 I am a Research Engineer at the CNRS, based at the  CerCo in Toulouse, France.

🔬 I am passionate about Mumltimodal Representation Learning, NeuroAI, and AI/ML for healthcare. Committed to developing technologies that enhance lives.

📚 I've completed my Master's Thesis from IIT Bombay at the junction of natural language processing (NLP), machine learning (ML), and computational social science.


# Research Experience
##  Mental Disorder Identification through Linguistic Markers | Master's Thesis, IIT Bombay
Guide: [Prof. Pushpak Bhattacharyya, CFILT Lab](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~pb/)
- Proposed a unique method to convert social media text into time series data for post‑level analysis of mental disorders
- Developed a novel framework for mental disorder identification via foundational deep learning models which surpasses the
performance of BERT‑based approaches by 5% in the F1 score on mental conditions: Depression, Self‑harm, and Anorexia
- Explored semantic overlaps among these disorders, underscoring the value of cross‑domain data in mental health research
  
##  Cognitively Inspired Hallucination Detection | Research Project, UT Austin & IIT Bombay
Guide:  [Prof. Abhijit Mishra](https://abhijitmishra.github.io/) & [Prof. Pushpak Bhattacharyya](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~pb/)
- Curated eye‑tracking data with 500 instances for the task of hallucination detection and developed a BERT‑based framework
- Proposed a novel attention bias framework inspired by human behavior for detecting hallucinated texts

##  Multimodal Mixup Contrastive Learning for Multimodal Classification | Research Project, Monash University & IIT Bombay
Guide:  [Prof. Kshitij Jadhav](https://scholar.google.ch/citations?hl=en&user=VY8oCm0AAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate) & [Dr. Deval Mehta](https://sites.google.com/view/mehtadeval)
- Implemented a multimodal contrastive learning objective for image‑text classification using the extension of mixup strategy
- Experimented using unimodality supervision, cross‑attention on diverse datasets (N24News, ROSMAP, BRCA, and Food‑101)

# Professional Experience
I have professional experience working as an **AI Student Researcher** at Assert AI. \
There, I deployed customized YOLOv4 models for surveillance tasks leveraging the Nvidia Jetson series GPU accelerators, generated tailored datasets and trained YOLOv4 models for diverse object detection and classification scenarios.
