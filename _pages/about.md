👨🏻‍💻 I am a final-year student pursuing a BTech + MTech (Interdisciplinary Dual Degree) in Materials Science and Healthcare Informatics at IIT Bombay.

🔬 I am passionate about applying AI in healthcare, focusing on biomedical data science, NeuroAI, Deep Learning, Computer Vision, and Natural Language Processing. I aim to leverage expertise in these areas to advance medical diagnosis and improve patient well-being through innovative AI solutions.

📚 I'm currently working towards my Master's Thesis at the junction of natural language processing (NLP), machine learning (ML), and computational social science.


# Research Experience
##  Mental Disorder Identification through Linguistic Markers | Master's Thesis, IIT Bombay
Guide: [Prof. Pushpak Bhattacharyya, CFILT Lab](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~pb/)
- Proposed a unique method to convert social media text into time series data for post‑level analysis of mental disorders
- Developed a novel framework for mental disorder identification via foundational deep learning models which surpasses the
performance of LLM‑based approaches by 4.67% in the F1 score on mental conditions: Depression, Self‑harm, and Anorexia
- Explored semantic overlaps among these disorders, underscoring the value of cross‑domain data in mental health research
  
##  Cognitively Inspired Hallucination Detection | Research Project, UT Austin & IIT Bombay
Guide:  [Prof. Abhijit Mishra](https://abhijitmishra.github.io/) & [Prof. Pushpak Bhattacharyya](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~pb/)
- Curated eye‑tracking data with 500 instances for the task of hallucination detection and developed a BERT‑based framework
- Proposed a novel attention bias framework inspired by human behavior for detecting hallucinated texts
- Currently experimenting with prompt‑based approaches for hallucination detection and mitigation in dialogue setting

##  Semi‑Supervised Medical Image Classification | R&D Project, IIT Bombay
Guide:  [Prof. Kshitij Jadhav](https://www.kcdh.iitb.ac.in/people/)
- Devised a method to classify lymphocytic cells in WSI patches using the SAM followed by Semi‑Supervised Data Programming
- Implemented a pipeline for image segmentation followed by classification, resulting in a 0.75 F1 score using 800 segments
- Demonstrated superiority of the pipeline over ResNet18 in medical image classification with limited training data

##  Depression Severity Prediction using Text Transcript | R&D Project, IIT Bombay
Guide: [Prof. Pushpak Bhattacharyya](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~pb/)
- Implemented depression severity prediction in interview transcripts using word embedding vectors: Glove, Word2Vec, BERT
- Evaluated model performance using cross‑entropic test loss, with BERT‑based model achieving F1‑score of 0.90
- Conducted live demo of the system to predict one out of five depression severity in texts using Hugging Face hub and gradio

# Professional Experience
I have professional experience working as an **AI Student Researcher** at Assert AI. \
There, I deployed customized YOLOv4 models for surveillance tasks leveraging the Nvidia Jetson series GPU accelerators, generated tailored datasets, and trained YOLOv4 models for diverse object detection and classification scenarios.
