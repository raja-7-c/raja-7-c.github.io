title: "Eyes Show the Way: Modelling Gaze Behaviour for Hallucination Detection"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2022-Arena-Bench
excerpt: 'Detecting hallucinations in natural language
processing (NLP) is a critical undertaking that
demands a deep understanding of both the semantic and pragmatic aspects of languages.
Cognitive approaches that leverage users’ behavioural signals, such as gaze, have demonstrated effectiveness in addressing NLP tasks
with similar linguistic complexities. However,
their potential in the context of hallucination
detection remains largely unexplored. In this
paper, we propose a novel cognitive approach
for hallucination detection that leverages gaze
signals from humans. We first collect an eyetracking corpus consisting of 500 instances, annotated by 5 annotators for the task of hallucination detection. Our analysis reveals that humans selectively attend to relevant parts of the
text based on distributional similarity, similar to
the attention bias phenomenon in psychology.
We identify two attention strategies employed
by humans: global attention, which focuses
on the most informative sentence, and local
attention, which focuses on important words
within a sentence. Leveraging these insights,
we propose a novel cognitive framework for
hallucination detection that incorporates these
attention biases. Experimental evaluations on
the FactCC dataset demonstrate the efficacy of
our approach, obtaining a balanced accuracy of
87.1%. Our study highlights the potential of
gaze-based approaches in addressing the task
of hallucination detection and sheds light on
the cognitive processes employed by humans
in identifying inconsistencies.'
